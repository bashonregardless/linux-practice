o/p

sys     0m0.147s


Observation
sys time significantly higher in latter. This shows that
context switch from user mode to kernel mode is higher,
the processor is for more time in kernel mode than user
mode. VERIFY?
REASON?




With O_SYNC flag

13-3)
The effect of the following statements
`
fflush(fp);
fsync(fileno(fp));
`
is that data in the stdio output stream will be forced
to be written (i.e, flushed to a kernel buffer via write()).
If stream (here, fp), fflush() flushes all stdio buffers.

The fsync() system call causes the buffered data and all 
metadata associated with the open file descriptor fd to be
flushed to disk. Calling fsync() forces the file to the 
synchronized I/O file integrity completion state.
An fsync() call returns only after the transfer to the disk
device (or at least its cache) has completed.
