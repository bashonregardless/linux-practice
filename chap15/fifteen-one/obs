This file was created from linux-practice/ dir as a side effect of command
`git add . > chap15/fifteen-one/obs`

Able to write and save this file from linux-practice/ dir.

`git add .` command gives error:
  warning: unable to access 'chap15/fifteen-one/testdir/.gitignore': Permission denied
  error: open("chap15/fifteen-one/test.c"): Permission denied
  error: unable to index file chap15/fifteen-one/test.c
  fatal: adding files failed
  
Now I will change the permissiions on dir chap15/fifteen-one/testdir/
