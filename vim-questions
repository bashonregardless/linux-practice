1. How to yank (and not visually select) in reverse direction from character under 
  cursor (including the character under cursor) to some character?
  Note the default behaviour of vim is that the character under the cursor
  is not yanked.

3. How to yank contiguous lines in ex mode and paste below the cursor.
   
   Current method:
   As of now I first go to the first line of the contiguos lines to be copied.
   Then use visual mode to hilight the contiguos lines, yank them and then
   I go back to the line where I want to paste them.
