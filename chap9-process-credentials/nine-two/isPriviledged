Q. Is a process with the following user IDs privileged? Explain your answer.

real=0 effective=1000 saved=1000 file-system=1000

A. The process is not priviledged with the current IDs.
   The process can become priviledged by making following
   system calls:
   a. setuid(0)
   b. seteuid(0)
   c. setreuid(-1, 0)
   d. setresuid(-1, 0, 1000)

TODO Verify if the system calls are correct or not.
